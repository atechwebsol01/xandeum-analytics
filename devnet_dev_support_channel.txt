Or you take a look at the Xandeum Github page. These things should be trustless and open source.
Brad|Xandeum I'm NOT DM'ing YOU — 16/12/2025, 21:06
Some things have evolved since the white paper...the green pager is likely better...

But to answer the question on pNode vs pod...

a pNode is the collective hardware (server)
and pod is a piece of software that runs on the pNdode taking care of storage functions
xandminer is the name of the software GUI for managment
xandminerd is the daemon that feeds information to xandminer... 
Brad|Xandeum I'm NOT DM'ing YOU — 16/12/2025, 21:09
Each pNode has a storage pod inside...but no, there is no col-located nodes. We will have pods that are part of a redunancy group but it is more of a random function not having to do with location...
That's not to say there arent 2 or more pNodes in the same data center anywhere either though...

Hey everyone! I’m building for the Superteam pNode Analytics bounty and need some clarification on APIs:

• I tried connecting to the shared pRPC IPs on port 6000 (e.g., the ones previously posted) but I’m getting connection refused. Are there any pNodes running with --rpc-ip 0.0.0.0 or otherwise exposed for public API access?

• I’m currently pulling pod credit data from a public endpoint that returns a list of all pods and their credits — basically the JSON at p o d c r e d i t s . x a n d e u m . n e t w o r k under /api/pods-credits. Can I rely on that as the main source for all active pNodes?

• If a public pRPC endpoint exists, does it support CORS so I can call it directly from browser/JS?

• If not, is the recommended approach to just spin up my own pNode to get full RPC access?

Thanks!

Anil Kumar Reddy — 17/12/2025, 17:27
Which port exposes pnRPC on these nodes?
Is there a standard pnRPC URL format? (e.g., http://IP:PORT)
What is the method name to list pNodes in gossip?
Is there a devnet/testnet node you recommend using?

@Brad|Xandeum I'm NOT DM'ing YOU I typed a pretty solid message earlier, included a message link — but the bot ate it 😭.

essentially, I was asking about how to run get-stats for other pNodes. I know this has been mentioned before, but I’d appreciate another quick rundown or clarification. thanks
Brad|Xandeum I'm NOT DM'ing YOU — 17/12/2025, 17:40
so get-stats runs against the pnode at the ip address the command is pointed at...
the get-pods-with-stats call runs against all pNodes that the particular machine ip address you used in the call, sees in gossip via internal communication
So as long as you have a publicly accessible pRPC then you can get info about all the nodes in gossip...
Ymetro

 — 17/12/2025, 17:43
For an outside call of get-stats for detailed information about that node, the node must be publicly accessible, right?
Brad|Xandeum I'm NOT DM'ing YOU — 17/12/2025, 17:44
correct ,that on only works where there is a public pRPC port on that machine...
Ymetro

 — 17/12/2025, 17:45
So there is no way of getting detailed information on the individual nodes that are not public?

If you run the wget install script, it should ask for the location of your private key and if you want to make it a public one. (it binds TCP port 6000 to 0.0.0.0).

vs get-pods-with-stats doesn;t show cpu, streams ram, etc...those are more for someone to see for their own machine not public really...but maybe well expose some prometeus metrics at some point...but shows some stats for all nodes in gossip right now

@Brad|Xandeum I'm NOT DM'ing YOU I'm currently running the pNode. It seem to not have the details I'm looking for.

Sorry I don't understand your question. What I'm saying is I want to build a graph of how message is exchanged through out the network. I plan to use how nodes connect to one another in this network to determine that.

Thanks! I tried reaching the pRPC endpoint on the node at 216(dot)234(dot)134(dot)5 port 6000 but I’m getting an “Access denied” response.

I devised a curl command  line for local nodes that shows what pNodes are publicly available ending with a total count.
Please replace "127.0.0.1" to a publicly available pNode IP address when you're not running a node yourself (but then again you have to somehow acquire one 😉): 
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:6000/rpc \
                          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
                          -d '{

                            "id": 1
                          }' |
                     jq . |                                   
                     grep -B1 '"is_public": true' |
                     grep '"address"' |
                     tee /dev/tty |
                     wc -l |
                     awk '{print "Total public nodes:", $1}'
 
Port numbers are added, because a few are on nonstandard ports (not on port 9001).
So devs can pick one to call.

Hi. With "127.0.0.1" you're calling your local system, that has no node running. Please pick one of the public nodes, mentioned earlier, for results.

The pNode net seems fine.
Pick a few to have redundancy failover.

Yo
I'm done with this analytics dashboard
But im stuck at this point like the pNodes, it should refresh after how much second ?
right now i am keeping it at 20sec, but because of that, the page becomes kinda laggy and also the map part(i tried some other way, and i think it's good).
takes little bit time but I guess better than not showing a map.
so should I go with 30-40sec
or some other way

[Collector] ⚠️  Very low success rate (0.0%). This may indicate:
   
Network connectivity issues
pNodes are offline or behind firewalls
Incorrect IP addresses in database
What is the standard pRPC port for Xandeum pNodes? 
I'm using port 6000, but some nodes aren't responding. 
Are there different ports for different node versions, or do some nodes use non-standard ports?
Ymetro

 — 19/12/2025, 14:35
Most pNode are in private mode. You can get one of the list here  ⁠devnet-developer-support⁠ and fetch some more public ones with ⁠devnet-developer-support⁠ when you replace '127.0.0.1' with a public open node.
Ymetro

 — 19/12/2025, 14:36
Port 6000 is the right port for the pRPC.
Bobby1337

 — 19/12/2025, 14:36
oh thank you!!!
Ymetro

 — 19/12/2025, 14:37
The ports in the list are ports used to connect them to their own gossip network. RP calls go to one of the nodes that have port 6000 public.
I've should have mentioned that the ports shown in the list are for gossip, not pRP calls.
Ymetro

 — 19/12/2025, 14:38
Also: to get a bit less info on all the nodes use get-pod-with-stats in the call.
I call it less bc the most stats are shown with the get-stats call, but that is only possible on public nodes.

I didn't know what's causing it to lag...
Might need caching? 
Might need less updates? 
Maybe on demand vs real time updates? 

Maybe need to stagger what updates.... Batches of 10 maybe?

Batches of 10 is good, but that way user will have to click that next next again and again(which is kinda annoying)
Also I've added caching.
And fixed re renders.
now it works 10x better than before.

Hey guys do we have any rpc that can be accessible via vercel or public
@Ymetro
Ymetro

 — Yesterday at 01:14
Do you mean more public IPs? Here is a few: ⁠devnet-developer-support⁠
minus the port number. That stays on 6000 for RPC. 
I'm not familiar with Vercel. 
All the calls are get-pods, get-pods-with-stats and get-stats (only on public ones), AFAIKO. 
Furthermore there is the https://podcredits.xandeum.network/api/pods-credits API for the credits.

A little ramble of mine. I hope you can see what I mean. - 
I wonder if the implementation of uptime is a good one. Most choose to "cure" it over time from 0 to 100%, but I think its the other way around: 100% when up and penalize when down for more than x minutes, and then cure over time. Just like in Uptime Kuma for example. Add a total, yearly and monthly history graph to check past performance. Not only Pod, Xandminer and Xandminerd needs to be updated and restarted, causing a rather long time to get good level of that reputational uptime buildup, but the underlying platform must also be updated regularly, to prevent system instability and security breaches. Ubuntu Pro does some live patching to keep downtime to a minimum, but sometimes a restart is needed. I think system maintenance, being up-to-date and secure also has a factor in reliability and performance of the node. - ramble end.

Substance 2.42 — Yesterday at 11:32
My opinion, if I understand correctly :-), is that I won't invent some questionable formula to calculate e.g. reliability - just raw pRPC data and history graphs, done. And collect only data that are available for all pNodes, so no CPUs etc. - there will be none or almost none public pRPCs, current state is temporary devnet anomaly, you'll see. Or for example, how often would one check if pNode is online, every second? Good luck with that.
Also, xandminer(d) are irrelevant, they don't have to run at all.

Sorry, my programming level ain't that high to help. What's TS? Maybe @Brad|Xandeum I'm NOT DM'ing YOU can help?
Leo says: 

Key Causes and Fixes

Environment Variables Not Set in Vercel

Local environment variables (e.g., API keys, base URLs) are not automatically available on Vercel. You must manually add them in the Vercel dashboard or CLI.
→ Use process.env.API_URL instead of hardcoded values and ensure all secrets are configured in Vercel’s project settings.

Relative vs. Absolute URLs

Using relative URLs (e.g., /api/data) works locally because they resolve to localhost. On Vercel, you must use absolute URLs (e.g., https://yourdomain.com/api/data).
→ Construct URLs dynamically:
const baseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL 
  ? https://${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL} 
  : 'http://localhost:3000/';
const res = await fetch(${baseUrl}/api/data);

Outbound Requests Blocked or Misconfigured

Vercel allows outbound HTTP requests, but some third-party APIs may block requests based on headers, CORS, or IP reputation.
→ Ensure your API accepts requests from external domains and verify headers (e.g., User-Agent, Authorization) are correctly set.

Serverless Function Timeouts or Errors

Vercel serverless functions have execution limits (10s for Hobby, 60s Pro). Long-running or unhandled API calls may fail silently.
→ Add error handling and logging to debug failures.

So TS is "TypeScript, a programming language that extends JavaScript by adding static typing and other features." - Okay..
Davethompson ☕ — Yesterday at 17:03
extended version of javascript but with type safety and security

@Brad|Xandeum I'm NOT DM'ing YOU wondering how you get your number for storage used on your dashboard cause I don't get that number at all 
Ninja0x

sure scammer 😄
Brad|Xandeum I'm NOT DM'ing YOU — 02:20
most of the data used right now is on a test rig...but you can convert the storage_used field from bytes to MB for all the pods...
curl -X POST http://192.190.136.28:6000/rpc \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "get-pods-with-stats",
  "id": 1
}' | jq

example:
    {
      "address": "94.255.130.13:12864",
      "is_public": false,
      "last_seen_timestamp": 1766278388,
      "pubkey": "8PjjPkizL4JZ54sPzNdXP99XyegcXrayv7rpfAY8EdzB",
      "rpc_port": 6000,
      "storage_committed": 17540000000000,
      "storage_usage_percent": 1.655074116305587e-8,
      "storage_used": 2903,
      "uptime": 230679,
      "version": "0.8.0"
    },

We'll be releasing more in the coming weeks where users will be able to put data on chain as our MVP (minimally viable product) will go live as the full working proof of concept.

Hey bro need a help actually I was also working on my dashboard and while setting up backend my dashboard works good but later on it suddenly stops showing real data can I come to know how you are setting it up means port usage and ips that you are rooting in it and is there any update in ips or I am thinking to show some defined number nodes 
can you please help me out bro

Bro if I make possible such that only this amount of nodes live on my analytical dashboard then it will be ok as making mvp so trying to reduce redundancy and showing less number as sometimes it also goes offline or we get problems in hosting as well

I'm not quite sure what you are saying, but if you want that list yourself use 
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:6000/rpc \
                          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
                          -d '{
                            "jsonrpc": "2.0",
                            "method": "get-pods-with-stats",
                            "id": 1
                          }' |
                     jq . |                                   
                     grep -B1 '"is_public": true' |
                     grep '"address"' |
                     tee /dev/tty |
                     wc -l |
                     awk '{print "Total public nodes:", $1}'
 
And replace the '127.0.0.1' part with one of the IPs I listed.
