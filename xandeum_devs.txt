update on the clients
you can now configure timeouts when creating clients(cool if you’ll be running longer queries…yeahhh)
the client now comes with a default list of seed ips(can be configurable, see any of the README doc for the list) and a helper function that queries them all concurrently to find a specific node ~8x faster
get:

+ JS/TS: pnpm install xandeum-prpc 
+ go: go get github . com/DavidNzube101/xandeum-prpc-go 
construct the url properly in your end >_< the community bot’s ruthless 
+ rust: cargo add xandeum-prpc 
ty • happy building
