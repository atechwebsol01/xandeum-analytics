Track:
pNodes online/offline/syncing
storage capacity + utilization
reputation + uptime
version distribution + public/private breakdown
search/filter/export (CSV) + node details

Built for the Xandeum Analytics Platform Bounty [Pro]. Awaiting Platform Vetting by/from the Xandeum Team.


Built Xandeum pNode Analytics Platform for Superteam bounty

**Features:**
*3D Globe Visualization* — Interactive WebGL globe showing real-time global node distribution
*Real-time Dashboard* — Monitor network health, storage usage, and active nodes
*Historical Trends* — Track network metrics over time (1 hour to 30 days)
*Geographic Distribution* — IP geolocation with automatic tracking and country statistics
*Node Detail Pages* — Individual metrics, latency, storage, activity timelines, and heatmaps
*Activity Heatmap* — 7x24 grid visualization showing node activity patterns
*Downtime Reports* — Track incidents with MTTR analysis
*Theme Support* — Dark/light modes with system preference detection
*Auto-Updating* — Real-time data refresh with TanStack Query

**Tech Stack:**
Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, Three.js, PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, Tailwind CSS 4

Every metric is calculated from real pNode data **(no mock data)** collected via pRPC endpoints every minute.

**Interactive 3D globe features:**
- Visual connections between node locations
- Hover tooltips with IP, location, and node count
- Clickable nodes with detailed information sheets
- Auto-rotation with manual orbit controls
- Theme-aware rendering

Project Name: Xandeum Nexus Sentinel 🤖

Most dashboards are passive, you have to remember to check them. I built Sentinel as an active layer that watches your pNode for you. It pings you on Telegram the second your health score drops or you fall out of gossip so you can stop the "dashboard fatigue" and actually sleep at night.

Note: This is a v1.0.0 prototype built for the Xandeum/Superteam bounty. I’m running it on Google Cloud for stability. Would love to have the Xandeum team vet it and hear what the pNode fam thinks!

Right now they are ~30 second heartbeats that give +1 credit and -100 credit if it misses a data operation.
They will reset monthly


https://podcredits.xandeum.network/api/pods-credits
Removed timeout.
The credits are a measure of reliability (reputation) for a pnode.
